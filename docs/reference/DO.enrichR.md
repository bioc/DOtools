# DO.enrichR

Performs Gene Ontology enrichment analysis on differentially expressed
genes using the EnrichR API. Separately analyzes upregulated and
downregulated genes and returns results.

## Usage

``` r
DO.enrichR(
  df_DGE,
  gene_column,
  pval_column,
  log2fc_column,
  pval_cutoff = 0.05,
  log2fc_cutoff = 0.25,
  path = NULL,
  filename = "",
  species = "Human",
  go_catgs = c("GO_Molecular_Function_2023", "GO_Cellular_Component_2023",
    "GO_Biological_Process_2023")
)
```

## Arguments

- df_DGE:

  data.frame containing differential gene expression results.

- gene_column:

  column name in `df` with gene symbols.

- pval_column:

  column name in `df` with p-values.

- log2fc_column:

  column name in `df` with log2 fold changes.

- pval_cutoff:

  adjusted p-value threshold for significance (default = 0.05).

- log2fc_cutoff:

  log2 fold change threshold for up/down regulation (default = 0.25).

- path:

  folder path where the output Excel file will be saved. A subfolder
  "GSA_Tables" will be created.

- filename:

  suffix used in the Excel filename (e.g.,
  "GSA_CellType_MyAnalysis.xlsx").

- species:

  species name for enrichment analysis. Options include "Human",
  "Mouse", "Yeast", etc. (default = "Mouse").

- go_catgs:

  GO databases to use. Defaults to c(GO_Biological_Process_2023").

## Value

data.frame with GO enrichment results if `path` is NULL, otherwise
writes an Excel file.
